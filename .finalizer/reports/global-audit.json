  "arch_observations": [
    "[ARCH] Tenant public landing page sections each have independent visibility flags from TenantLandingService. Consider adding a single 'hasContent' computed property to simplify template conditionals.",
    "[ARCH] Admin dashboard stat queries are now inline in DashboardController. As the platform grows, consider extracting to a DashboardStatsService for testability.",
    "[ARCH] Cook Performance analytics query selects tenant slug via selectRaw(). This works but is fragile to refactors. Consider adding a $cook->slug accessor or relationship.",
    "Email verification enforced via banner but cooks can still access /dashboard without verifying. Appears intentional per spec."
