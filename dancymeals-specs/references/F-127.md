## What It Does
Renders the hero section at the top of the cook's tenant landing page. Displays the cook's brand name prominently, a tagline or short bio excerpt, and a cover image carousel (up to 5 images) with auto-animation. Includes a call-to-action button ("View Meals" or "Order Now") that scrolls to the meals grid section. Shows the cook's average star rating and total review count as a compact badge.

## Who Uses It
| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Client (guest or authenticated) | Views the hero section to understand the cook's brand and click through to meals |
| Cook | Sees how their brand is presented in the hero section |

## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Full hero section
A visitor arrives at `latifa.dm.test`. The hero section shows "Chef Latifa" in large typography, "Authentic Cameroonian flavors, made with love" as the tagline, a carousel of 4 cover images cycling every 5 seconds with smooth transitions, a "View Meals" button, and a badge showing "4.7 stars (128 reviews)".

### Scenario 2: Cook with one image
A cook has only one cover image uploaded. The hero displays that single image as a static background without carousel animation. All other elements render normally.

### Scenario 3: Cook with no images
A cook has no cover images. The hero section displays a gradient background using the tenant's theme colors instead. The brand name, tagline, CTA button, and rating still display.

### Scenario 4: New cook with no reviews
A recently onboarded cook has zero reviews. Instead of showing "0 stars", the rating badge shows "New Cook" or is hidden entirely. The CTA button still appears.

### Scenario 5: Mobile view
On mobile, the hero section takes less vertical space. The cover images display at a smaller aspect ratio. The brand name, tagline, and CTA button stack vertically and are centered.
