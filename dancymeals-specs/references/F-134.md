## What It Does
Provides WhatsApp contact integration and social media links on the cook's tenant landing page. Includes a floating WhatsApp chat button that opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message to the cook, social media links (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) in the footer, and a click-to-call phone number. These are always accessible to visitors, providing a direct communication channel with the cook.

## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: WhatsApp floating button
A visitor sees a green WhatsApp icon floating in the bottom-right corner of the page. They click it. WhatsApp opens (app or web) with a pre-filled message: "Hi Chef Latifa, I'm interested in ordering from DancyMeals!" addressed to the cook's phone number.

### Scenario 2: Social media links in footer
The visitor scrolls to the footer and sees icons for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. They click the Instagram icon and are taken to the cook's Instagram profile in a new tab.

### Scenario 3: Click-to-call
The footer also shows the cook's phone number: "+237 6XX XXX XXX". On mobile, clicking it initiates a phone call. On desktop, clicking it copies the number to clipboard.

### Scenario 4: Cook with no social links
A cook has only a WhatsApp number configured but no social media links. The footer shows only the WhatsApp number and phone. Social media icon section is hidden.

### Scenario 5: Mobile WhatsApp button
On mobile, the floating WhatsApp button is slightly smaller and positioned to not overlap with other navigation elements. Tapping it opens the WhatsApp app directly.
