## What It Does

Displays a panel of contextual quick action buttons on the dashboard home page. The default actions include: Create New Meal, View Pending Orders, Update Availability, and View Wallet. The panel is contextual -- it adapts based on the cook's current state. For example, if the setup wizard is incomplete, a "Complete Setup" action replaces one of the defaults. If there are pending orders, the "View Pending Orders" button shows the count.

## Who Uses It

| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Cook | Clicks quick action buttons for common tasks |
| Manager | Sees actions relevant to their permissions |

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard quick actions
A cook with a complete setup sees 4 quick action buttons: "Create New Meal", "View Pending Orders (3)", "Update Availability", "View Wallet." Clicking any button navigates to the relevant section via Gale.

### Scenario 2: Setup incomplete
A cook whose setup wizard is incomplete sees "Complete Setup" as the first (most prominent) action button. The other 3 default actions still appear but "Complete Setup" is highlighted.

### Scenario 3: No pending orders
The "View Pending Orders" button shows "(0)" and is still clickable, navigating to the orders page.

### Scenario 4: Manager with limited permissions
A manager who cannot access the Wallet sees only 3 quick actions (Wallet action hidden). Actions are permission-aware.

### Scenario 5: Quick action navigation
A cook clicks "Create New Meal." They are navigated to the meal creation form via Gale without page reload. The sidebar active state updates to "Meals."

- Horizontal row of action buttons on desktop; 2x2 grid on mobile
- Each button: icon + label + optional badge/count
- "Complete Setup" uses a distinct warning/accent color to stand out
- Buttons have hover states with subtle scale effect
- Compact design that doesn't dominate the dashboard home page
- Positioned between stat cards and recent orders list
