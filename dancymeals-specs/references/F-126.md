## What It Does
Renders the main layout for a cook's branded tenant website. When a visitor arrives at a cook's subdomain or custom domain, this feature provides the full page shell with the cook's selected theme applied (colors, fonts, border radiuses from F-011). The layout includes a responsive navigation bar, hero section placeholder, content sections (meals grid, about/bio, ratings summary, testimonials, schedule, delivery areas), and a footer with social links. Navigation items: Home, Meals, About, Contact. Auth links (Login/Register or user menu) are displayed in the header. All sections are scroll-anchored for single-page navigation.

## Who Uses It
| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Client (guest or authenticated) | Visits a cook's branded website and browses all sections |
| Cook | Sees their branded website as clients see it |
| Manager | Can view the tenant site to verify branding |

## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: First visit to a cook's site
A visitor navigates to `latifa.dm.test`. The tenant resolves via F-004, the cook's selected theme is applied (e.g., Modern theme with Poppins font and rounded corners), and the full landing page renders with the navigation bar, hero section, meals grid, about section, and footer.

### Scenario 2: Mobile browsing
A visitor opens the cook's site on their phone. The navigation collapses to a hamburger menu. All sections stack vertically. The layout is optimized for touch interaction and mobile viewports.

### Scenario 3: Authenticated client visit
A logged-in client visits the cook's site. The navigation shows their name/avatar with a dropdown (My Orders, My Favorites, Settings, Logout) instead of Login/Register links.

### Scenario 4: Theme customization applied
The cook has selected the "Neo Brutalism" theme with Inter font and sharp corners. The entire landing page reflects these choices: bold borders, no border radius, Inter typography throughout.

### Scenario 5: Section navigation
The visitor clicks "Meals" in the navigation. The page smoothly scrolls to the meals grid section. The URL hash updates to `#meals`. All section links work as anchor scrolls via Gale navigation.

| BR-131 | All user-facing text must use `__('English text')` localization |
| BR-132 | The page must support light and dark mode, respecting the tenant's theme in both modes |
| BR-133 | Page sections render in order: hero, meals grid, about/bio, ratings summary, testimonials, schedule, delivery areas, footer |
