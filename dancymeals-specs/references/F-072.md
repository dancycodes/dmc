## What It Does

Wizard Step 1. Collects the cook's brand information: cook/brand name (in both English and French), bio/description (in both English and French), WhatsApp number, phone number, and optional social media links (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok). All text fields are localized. The cook saves their brand info and continues to the next step.

## Who Uses It

| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Cook | Fills in their brand name, bio, contact details, and social links |
| Manager | May fill in brand info if permitted |

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete brand info
A cook enters their brand name in English ("Chef Latifa's Kitchen") and French ("La Cuisine de Chef Latifa"), writes a bio in both languages, enters their WhatsApp number (+237 6XX XXX XXX), phone number, and pastes their Instagram URL. They click "Save & Continue" and advance to Step 2.

### Scenario 2: Minimal required info
A cook enters only the required fields: brand name in English and French, and WhatsApp number. They leave bio, phone, and social links empty. They click "Save & Continue" and advance. The step is marked complete because the minimum (brand name in both languages) is met.

### Scenario 3: Validation errors
A cook enters a brand name in English but leaves the French name empty. They click "Save & Continue." A validation error appears: "Brand name is required in both English and French." The form remains on Step 1.

### Scenario 4: Return to edit
A cook returns to Step 1 from a later step. All previously saved data is pre-populated. They edit the bio and save again.
