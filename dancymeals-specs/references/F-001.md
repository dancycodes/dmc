# F-001 — Laravel Project Scaffolding

## What It Does
Creates a fresh Laravel 12 project as the base for DancyMeals. Configures the environment file with the application name "DancyMeals", sets the app URL for local development, prepares PostgreSQL as the database driver, and establishes the initial directory structure conventions that all subsequent features will follow.

---

## Who Uses It
| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Developer | Runs the scaffolding, configures .env, verifies the app boots |

---

## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Fresh project creation
The developer creates a new Laravel 12 project, configures `.env` with `APP_NAME=DancyMeals`, `APP_URL=http://dm.test`, and `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql`. The application boots successfully at the configured URL via Laravel Herd.

### Scenario 2: Directory structure verification
The developer confirms the standard Laravel 12 directory structure is present and that no extraneous files or configurations remain from the installer defaults that conflict with project conventions.

### Scenario 3: Environment misconfiguration
The developer attempts to boot the application with an incomplete `.env` file (missing database credentials or app key). Laravel displays a clear error and the developer corrects the configuration.

---

## Business Rules
| Code | Rule |
|------|------|
| BR-001 | Application name must be "DancyMeals" in all environment and config files |
| BR-002 | Database driver must be set to `pgsql` (PostgreSQL) |
| BR-003 | App URL must reflect the Laravel Herd local domain (`http://dm.test`) |
| BR-004 | Application key must be generated via `php artisan key:generate` |
| BR-005 | Debug mode must be enabled for local development (`APP_DEBUG=true`) |
| BR-006 | Timezone should be set to `Africa/Douala` (Cameroon) |

---

## Data Involved
**Creates:**
- `.env` file with DancyMeals-specific configuration
- Application encryption key

**Reads:**
- `.env.example` as the base template

**Updates:**
- `config/app.php` defaults (name, timezone, locale)

**Relationships:**
- None (first feature in the chain)

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a fresh Laravel 12 install, **when** `.env` is configured with `APP_NAME=DancyMeals`, `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql`, and `APP_URL=http://dm.test`, **then** the application boots without errors
- **Given** the configured project, **when** accessing `http://dm.test` in a browser, **then** the Laravel welcome page loads successfully
- **Given** the `.env` file, **when** inspecting the `APP_NAME` value, **then** it reads "DancyMeals"
- **Given** the `.env` file, **when** inspecting the timezone config, **then** it is set to `Africa/Douala`

---

## Verification Steps
1. Run `php artisan about` and confirm app name shows "DancyMeals" and environment is "local"
2. Run `php artisan key:generate --show` and confirm a valid key is present
3. Access `http://dm.test` in a browser and confirm the welcome page renders
4. Confirm `.env` contains `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql`
5. Run `php artisan config:show app` and verify timezone is `Africa/Douala`

---

## Edge Cases & Exceptions
| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Missing `.env` file | Laravel fails to boot with a clear error; developer copies `.env.example` |
| Port conflict on local machine | Laravel Herd handles port assignment; no manual port config needed |
| Missing PHP extensions for PostgreSQL | Error on first database connection attempt; developer installs `pdo_pgsql` |

---

## UI/UX Notes
No user-facing UI at this stage. This is a developer-only infrastructure feature.

## Related Features
| Code | Feature | Relationship |
|------|---------|-------------|
| F-002 | Database Configuration | Depends on this feature for base project and .env setup |
| F-003 | Core Package Installation | Depends on this feature for composer.json and project structure |
