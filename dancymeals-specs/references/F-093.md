## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View pickup locations
A cook navigates to the Locations section and scrolls to or clicks the "Pickup Locations" tab. They see 2 locations: "My Kitchen — Douala, Akwa — Behind Akwa Palace Hotel" and "Market Stall — Douala, Bonaberi — Next to Total station." Each has Edit and Delete buttons.

### Scenario 2: Empty list
A cook with no pickup locations sees: "No pickup locations added yet. Add a pickup location so clients can collect their orders." with an "Add Pickup Location" button.

### Scenario 3: Multiple locations across towns
A cook has pickup locations in both Douala and Yaounde. The list shows all locations regardless of town, with the town name displayed for clarity.
