> Module: Cook Profile
> Priority: Must-have
> Precedence: F-076
> Type: functional

## What It Does

Displays the cook's brand profile as it will appear publicly on their tenant landing page. This is a preview/read-only view within the dashboard that shows the brand name, bio/description, cover images carousel, WhatsApp number, phone number, and social media links. Each section has an "Edit" link that navigates to the edit form (F-080). This allows the cook to review their public-facing profile before making changes.

## Who Uses It

| Role | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| Cook | Reviews their public brand profile and navigates to edit sections |
| Manager | Views the brand profile if they have profile view permission |

---

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View complete profile
A cook navigates to the Profile section in the dashboard. They see their brand name (in current locale), full bio, cover images cycling in a carousel, WhatsApp and phone numbers, and social links displayed as clickable icons. Each section has a small "Edit" pencil icon link.

### Scenario 2: View incomplete profile
A cook who skipped the cover images step sees the profile view with a placeholder where images would be and a prompt: "Add cover images to make your profile stand out." The "Edit" link navigates to the cover images management page.

### Scenario 3: Bilingual review
A cook switches the dashboard language from English to French. The brand name and bio switch to their French translations. The cook verifies both language versions look correct.

### Scenario 4: Manager viewing profile
A manager with profile view permission sees the same profile view but the "Edit" links may be hidden if they lack edit permission.
